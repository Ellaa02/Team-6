#### Question: How does the market respond to perceived risk in the market?
#### Data Examined: S&P 500 - Chosen to represent the overall U.S. Stock Market
####               Bitcoin - Chosen to represent cryptocurrency
####               Gold - Chosen to represent tangible assets
####               VIX - Chosen to represent market volatility and investor sentiment

### We are trying to show... 3 different investment vehicles alongside the 
### CBOE Volatility Index and see if they move independently, together, or
### perhaps opposite each other

# Takeaways:
#  S&P 500 shows a strong to very strong negative correlation with the CBOE Volatility Index. This is expected as
#  the sentiment of fear and uncertainty typically rises when the market falls.  Each of these symbols should
#  almost always move in opposite directions by definition of what each represents. 

#  Bitcoin shows it is strongly correlated with the S&P 500, a moderate correlation with Gold,
#  and a weak negative correlation with the VIX. This suggests Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset than a
#  safe-haven asset.

#  Gold has a weak positive correlation with the S&P 500 and a very weak positive correlation
#  with the VIX, indicating it does not move strongly with market risk sentiment. 
#  However, it has a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, suggesting some shared market drivers.
 
#  Overall, in 2024-2025, Bitcoin, previously seen as a potential safe-haven asset by some but not others, is showing
#  behavior more aligned with traditional investments like stocks, perhaps indicating growing trust among investors
#  in this particular cryptocurrency.

#  Gold, as a safe-haven asset, has shown typical fluctuations, especially during times of higher volatility, but
#  it has continued an overall steady increase in price over the time period shown. This shows that while market
#  volatility rises and falls routinely, there is a general concern about the instability of global markets
#  that is driving investors to tangible assets like gold.
