#### Question: How does the market respond to percieved risk in the market?
#### Data Examined: S&P 500 - Represents the overall Market
####               Bitcoin - Represents a high risk/high reward asset commonly used as a hedge against inflation
####               Gold - Represents a traditional safe-haven asset
####               VIX - Represents the market's expectation of used to measure market risk and sentiment

### We are trying to show... 3 different investment vehicles alongside the 
### CBOE Volatility Index and see if they move independently, together, or
### perhaps opposite each other

#Gold     0.682213  1.000000  0.300961  0.147123

# Takeaways:
#There is a strong negative correlation between the S&P 500 and the VIX. This is expected as sentiment of fear and uncertainty typically rises when the market falls.
#Bitcoin shows it is strongly correlated with the S&P 500, a moderate correaltion with Gold, and a weak negative correlation with the VIX. This suggests Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset than a safe-haven asset.
#Gold has a weak positive correlation with the S&P 500 and a very weak positive correlation with the VIX, indicating it does not move strongly with market risk sentiment. 
##However, it has a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, suggesting some shared market drivers.
# Overall, in 2024-2025, Bitcoin previously seen as a potential safe-haven asset, is showing behavior more aligned with risk assets like stocks rather than traditional safe-havens like Gold.
# Gold is not strongly acting as a safe-haven either, as it is not negatively correlated with the VIX or strongly related to the S&P 500.
# While the VIX is a strong indicator of market risk sentiment, neither Bitcoin nor Gold are moving inversely to it which brings their roles as safe-haven assets into question for this time period.
