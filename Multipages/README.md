#Project overview (problem, audience, value)
##This project was developed as an extension of our previous group project, which was a chart that displayed different ticker symbols that represented crypto currency (Bitcoin in US Dollars), tangible assets (Gold), stocks (S&P 500), and the CBOE Volatility Index.  We then had a simple correlation matrix that printed in the terminal.  The purpose of this was to see if there was any sort of correlation between the movement of each of those individual ticker symbols.  This project has a primary purpose of allowing people to do some basic research on a stock of their choice and then generate a chart and correlation matrix on the fly.  The Volatility Index and S&P 500 are prefilled but the user is able to enter as many as two stocks of their choice.  


##Problem:
###Individual investors often struggle to interpret stock movements. Without context, a single stock chart can be misleading, leading to poor decisions
##Audience:
###Our platform is designed for investors who want a clearer picture of how their chosen stock behaves relative to market volatility.
##Value:
###By allowing users to compare their stock of choice against the VIX(a volatility index that represents marketâ€™s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options), our platform provides essential context for decision making. The correlation matrix and the comparison graph empowers users to distinguish company performance from market wide trends, helping them make better investment choice.
